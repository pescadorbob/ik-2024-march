I'll help craft this into a technical interview question with different difficulty levels and clear evaluation criteria.

<CLAUDEMIND_THINKING>
1. The problem involves multiple concepts:
    - Dynamic programming
    - Constraint satisfaction
    - Optimization
    - Real-world application
2. It can be broken down into progressive difficulty levels
3. Should include clear problem statement, constraints, and examples

Here's how I would frame it as an interview question:

**Title**: Optimal Poker Chip Distribution System

**Initial Problem Statement**:
"A poker room needs to distribute chips to players at the start of a game. Design a system that determines the optimal distribution of poker chips to each player."

**Progressive Difficulty Levels**:

1. **Level 1 - Basic** (15 minutes):
```
Given:
- A target buy-in amount (e.g., $100)
- Available chip denominations [25¢, 50¢, $1, $5]
- Unlimited supply of each chip

Task: Find any valid combination of chips that sums to the target amount.

Example:
Input: target = $10, denominations = [25¢, 50¢, $1, $5]
Output: Any valid combination like: [5×$1, 1×$5] or [10×$1] or [2×$5]
```

2. **Level 2 - Intermediate** (20 minutes):
```
Added Constraint:
- Now you need to maximize the total number of chips each player gets
- Still unlimited supply of chips

Example:
Input: target = $10, denominations = [25¢, 50¢, $1, $5]
Output: Should prefer [40×25¢] over [10×$1] because 40 chips > 10 chips
```

3. **Level 3 - Advanced** (30 minutes):
```
Added Constraints:
- Limited supply of each chip color
- Each chip color must be assigned exactly one denomination
- Multiple players need the same distribution

Input Example:
- Target buy-in: $31
- Number of players: 10
- Available chips:
  * White chips: 149
  * Red chips: 143
  * Blue chips: 98
  * Green chips: 50
  * Black chips: 46
- Possible denominations: [25¢, 50¢, $1, $2, $5, $10]

Task: 
1. Assign denominations to chip colors
2. Find the distribution that maximizes chips per player
3. Ensure enough physical chips for all players
```

**Follow-up Questions**:
1. "How would your solution change if we needed to minimize the variance in chip counts between players?"
2. "What if we needed to support dynamic adding/removing of players during the game?"
3. "How would you modify your solution to handle multiple concurrent games?"

**Evaluation Criteria**:

1. **Problem Solving Approach**:
    - Breaking down the problem into manageable components
    - Identifying constraints and edge cases
    - Progressive optimization

2. **Technical Design**:
    - Data structure choices
    - Algorithm efficiency
    - Handling of constraints

3. **Code Quality**:
    - Clean, maintainable code
    - Error handling
    - Testing considerations

4. **System Design Considerations**:
    - Scalability
    - Performance
    - Maintainability

**Key Areas to Probe**:

1. **Algorithm Knowledge**:
    - Dynamic programming understanding
    - Optimization techniques
    - Constraint satisfaction

2. **Problem-Solving Skills**:
    - How they break down complex problems
    - Handling of edge cases
    - Optimization approaches

3. **Code Organization**:
    - Class/method structure
    - Separation of concerns
    - Error handling

**Red Flags to Watch For**:
1. Jumping straight to coding without analyzing the problem
2. Not considering physical chip constraints
3. Missing edge cases (like insufficient chips)
4. Not optimizing for maximum chips per player

**Green Flags**:
1. Methodical problem breakdown
2. Clear identification of constraints
3. Discussion of trade-offs
4. Consideration of real-world scenarios
5. Testing strategy discussion

**Time Allocation Suggestion**:
- 5 minutes: Problem clarification
- 10 minutes: High-level approach discussion
- 20-30 minutes: Implementation
- 10 minutes: Testing and optimization
- 5 minutes: Follow-up discussion

This question is particularly valuable because it:
1. Tests multiple skills (algorithms, optimization, constraints)
2. Has real-world applicability
3. Can be progressively complicated
4. Reveals thinking process
5. Has multiple valid approaches
6. Tests both theoretical knowledge and practical implementation

It's also a good question because it can be adapted based on the candidate's experience level and the position they're applying for, from entry-level focus on basic algorithms to senior-level focus on system design and optimization.
